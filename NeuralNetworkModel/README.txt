Todo:
	- connect the PDB parser into load_data(). Expecting two numpy arrays for features and labels
	- decide on the number of nodes per layer
	- decide on the number of hidden layers
	- fill in missing hyperparameter information
	- switch graphing output from display to write.
	
	- test network model with a small PDB subset for hyperparameter tuning.
